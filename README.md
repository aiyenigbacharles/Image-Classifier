# Image Classifier

This project is a machine learning model that classifies images as either 'Happy' or 'Sad'. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates the full workflow from data loading and preprocessing to training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## Features

- **Binary image classification:** Distinguishes between 'Happy' and 'Sad' images.
- **End-to-end workflow:** Data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and inference.
- **Interactive notebook:** All steps are explained and can be easily modified or extended.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common ML/data libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` or `keras` (depending on the notebook)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aiyenigbacharles/Image-Classifier.git
   cd Image-Classifier
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - If a `requirements.txt` exists:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Otherwise, install typical packages:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
     ```

3. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   - Open the notebook file (`.ipynb`) in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Organize your images into 'Happy' and 'Sad' classes as required by the notebook.
   - Update the data paths in the notebook if needed.

2. **Run the notebook cells:**
   - Follow each section, from data loading to model training and evaluation.
   - Modify parameters for experimentation.

3. **Make predictions:**
   - Use the provided code cells to classify new images.

## Notebook Structure

Typical sections in the notebook:

- **Introduction:** Problem statement and objectives.
- **Data Loading:** How images are read and structured.
- **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, augmentation, etc.
- **Model Building:** Neural network architecture and setup.
- **Training:** Model training loop/callbacks.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics and visualizations.
- **Inference:** Making predictions on new data.

---

## Customization

- **To add more classes:** Update the data labels and adjust the modelâ€™s output layer.
- **To use a different model:** Modify the model architecture cell in the notebook.
- **To experiment with hyperparameters:** Change learning rates, optimizers, batch sizes, etc.
